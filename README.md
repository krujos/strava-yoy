Running Tests
=============

The javascript tests come self contained. The prereq is to have [node](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
The rest of the needed stuff is in `static/js/test/node_modules`. It includes karma and jasmine.

    cd static/js/test
    ./test.sh #be amazed.

The python unit tests can be run with nose.
